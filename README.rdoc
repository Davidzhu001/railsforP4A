== Treebook

Social media app based on an outdated Treehouse course, completely rewritten and translated into Rails 4.2+ and RSpec 3+, ajaxified, with darker theme and additional features. To do:

* Fix feature tests
* Better UI
* Scope statuses instead of hiding blocked user statuses in views
* Make Friendship listing more dynamic
* Implement a working mailer
* Add commenting
* Fix status show view
* Work on profile pages
* Add photo uploading (Paperclip?)
* ...

Up-to-date live demo always available at: https://peaceful-tor-6610.herokuapp.com

NOTE: If you want to run this locally, you need to rename the config/database.yml.sample file to config/database.yml
and install Qt before even doing bundle install (capybara webkit needs it): https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit/wiki/Installing-Qt-and-compiling-capybara-webkit

Mailer temporarily disabled to prevent problems in production.

Some major differences compared to the original project:

* Bootswatch Slate theme instead of vanilla Bootstrap
* aasm gem instead of state_machine gem which is no longer maintained
* friendly_id gem for creating unique slugs for users
* gravtastic gem for taking care of Gravatars
* RSpec/Factory Girl/Capybara/Capybara Webkit for testing
* lambdas instead of conditions in model relationships
* upvoting/downvoting feature (ajaxified)
* Status pagination with will_paginate gem
* ...
